i put this frontend code here due to problem with importing Authenticator class .We can change this  in future if needed.

Try to run this code in eclipse.this Login window has some apperarance coding which is not working in Netbeans(Nimbuz style is set for buttons & gui which will be working in eclipse but for Netbeans there will be normal appearance)

i commented the session for opening new window when the username & password are correct & the user cliks the login button (in Login.java).We can put the rest of code
the code there(i mean call for opening new window)
